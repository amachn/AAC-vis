# CSI 2300 Project
This repository contains what will be my semester project for CSI 2300. 
- Currently all that exists in the repository is the gitignore and this README.md file.
- US Census Bureau shapefiles are stored in my local repository currently as they are too large to upload to GitHub. The shapefiles will hopefully be able to be trimmed significantly to the point of uploading to GitHub. These shapefiles will be utilized in location analysis of the dataset(s). 
- This project will be utilizing data from the [City of Austin Open Data Portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/), and subsequently analyzing animal intakes/outcomes at the Austin Animal Center.
